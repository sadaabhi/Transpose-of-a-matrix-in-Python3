# Transpose-of-a-matrix-in-Python3
In Python, we can implement a matrix as a nested list (list inside a list). We can treat each element as a row of the matrix.
For example X = [[1, 2], [4, 5], [3, 6]] would represent a 3x2 matrix. The first row can be selected as X[0]. And, the element in the first-row first column can be selected as X[0][0].
Transpose of a matrix is the interchanging of rows and columns. It is denoted as X'. The element at ith row and jth column in X will be placed at jth row and ith column in X'. So if X is a 3x2 matrix, X' will be a 2x3 matrix.
